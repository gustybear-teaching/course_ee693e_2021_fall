## Paper Summary
This paper provides a summary of telecommunications and its efforts in the United States education system and frontlines. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical school instructors have been reluctant to have their students be engaged in in-person curriculums, which includes experience in clinical rotations. To counter the pandemic while providing sufficient training to medical students, educators and frontline workers have accelerated the use of telecommunications in order for students to handle hospital-related tasks. Due to the advancement of telemedicine technology, the medical field has introduced 4 new applications of telemedicine to the curriculum: telesurgery; telerehabilitation; tele-intensive care units (tele-ICU); and chronic disease management and remote patient monitoring (RPM). The hope for the telemedicine training is to enrich students on how to use the technology in a professional and research-based manner.

## Review
### Strengths
- The telemedicine curriculum helps future doctors adapt to telemedicine during future pandemics
- The curriculum can help students acquire clinical skills and knowledge remotely
- Patients can be diagnosed and medicated while staying at home
- Clinical programs can continue to function while protecting medical staff and patients from COVID-19


### Weaknesses
- Telehealth visit disclosures can undermine the promotion of telemedicine to its patients, especially since multiple doctors have access to one patient’s records
- Patients may have limited access to technology or lack of internet connection that enables telemedicine in their homes
- Legal and liability issues become an overwhelming factor for the use of telemedicine in medical institutions
- Rapid implementation of high-quality telehealth training may lead to inconsistent quality care and risks to patient safety
- Insurance companies are hesistant to cover telemedicine costs


### Detailed Comments
The authors go into great depth on the background knowledge of telemedicine and its effects in medical education. However, when mentioning the 4 key areas: telesurgery; telerehabilitation; tele-ICU; and chronic disease management and RPM; the authors don’t provide enough concrete examples of these specialities, or they don’t opine on the technologies that they have cited. For example, haptic sensation feedback technology was the only specific technology mentioned in telesurgery, but it’s seen in an overwhelmingly positive manner. After reviewing the state-of-the-art, we have noticed that haptic feedback is limited to consumer products and more research needs to be done in haptic feedback for telesurgery. Since this paper is a perspective paper, it is justifiable that the authors can have a narrow-minded view on the technology.

However, if the telemedicine curriculum the authors mentioned go mainstream, we can have a new type of doctors who specialized on using technology to treat patients remotely. This new field can grow into its own industry like the software industry did in the new millennium. We could have new jobs we have not imagined yet (parallel to software engineers, DevOps ...). The pandemic has shown that there is a need for tele-medicine and incorporating it into the curriculum would create medical professionals that are better equipped to handle a future pandemic.


### Audience Questions
1. Will this approach in telemedicine for medical education affect student performances?

We assumed that the questioner was curious about how much this approach may affect a student’s performance in course-related work, so we will answer the question accordingly. Although not mentioned in the paper, a typical medical school program would have its students work on clinical rotations during their third year of medical school. The emphasis of using telemedicine for medical education is during the clinical training only. Hence, there should be no effect on a student’s performance in course-related work, since this is usually done during the first two years of medical school. 

2. What could be the biggest ethical concern relating to the tele-ICU concept?

The concept of the tele-ICU could jeopardize the American Medical Association’s (AMA) first principle of medical ethic, which is:

“A physician shall be dedicated to providing competent medical care, with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights.”
The idea of the tele-ICU can fragment the relationship between doctor and patient. Sometimes the decision of a patient’s life can only be made through on-site intervention, and the off-site physician may not be able to provide them assistance. A physician caring for a patient while distancing themselves could decrease the quality of competent medical care, especially since having an on-site intervention was always the primary method. It is important to note that tele-medicine is an alternative for those who could not get an on-site treatment. It is not meant to replace the in-person medical experience.

3. Considering the size/maneuverability of sensation feedback technology for telesurgery, do you think this technology will actually be feasible for telesurgery teaching or just for very specific applications?

It’s still very hard to determine the outcome of sensation feedback technology in telesurgery or any other application, especially since the current technology is limited to virtual reality. Since the current technology can be used to simulate the weights of household objects, we believe that it can be applied for microscale objects as well. Eventually, we hope that this technology can be used in collaboration with the da Vinci system to achieve true telesurgery.
