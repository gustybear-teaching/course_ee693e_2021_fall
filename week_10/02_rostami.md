### Discussion


### Questions
(1) Do you think other biometrics can be used for H2H? Something other than PV?
(2) Would there be a noticable difference in running time for the algorithm shown? Is it worth improving the n4logn time complexity?
(3) Would x86 or other CISC architecture offer a better performance in place of the ARM architecture?
