## Paper Summary
Data shows that the population of elders will increase significantly. This will lead to more elders needing medical care in thier personal homes. Today, more IoT technologies and software solutions are being used in the telehealth applications, such as this one! For this application, a home health monitoring system is useful for the elders who are in need of medical assisstance. An emerging technology of Artificial Intelligence can be utilize to solve these problems. For an AI system, each home will have to send data into a machine learning model in a cloud server. The server will then be used for user services. This approaches poses security risks by sending data wirelessly. This paer proposes in using Federated Learning to send model parameters, instead of data, wirelessly to the cloud server. This paper also explains the approach to solve Federated Learning problems using Generative AutoEncode and other algorithms. The paper shows good performance results using the AI system.

## Review
### Strengths
- Ensures data privacy by sending model parameters (using homomorphic encryption) and not actual data.
- Ensures higher accuracy by adding personalization schemes per edge clients.

### Weaknesses
- This system is computationally heavy.
- Hyper parameters might be harder to tune, and there are alot of them

### Detailed Comments


### Implementation
The paper provides an explanation into how they implemented their algorithm of Clicktok, as well as how they collected the data they used to train their model. The way they collected their data was by setting up traffic monitors on backbone routers of a university campus network. They collected a total of 217,334,190 unique clicks, between June 2015 and November 2017. The data was collected after obtaining ethical approval, and all stored data is encrypted. As for how they implemented their algorithm, they took the click traffic of each user (click stream), and attempted to decompose the click streams of each user into basic patterns by using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. This decomposes the click traces into pattern matrices, and weight matrices as to how often each pattern occurs.

They then use a moving window function to reduce sensitivity to synchronization errors from timing misalignments.

Afterwards by examining the weight matrix, they can determine which patterns are repeated and are potentially fraudulent clicks, as patterns matrices that are repeated can be attributed to organic click spam (fake clicks imitating user inputs). They cluster the closely related patterns matrices, to then determine inorganic click spam by finding clusters with a higher entropy, characteristic of clicks generated from a randomized/constant time offsets. The remaining clicks can then be attributed to real users.

Another technique Clicktok applies is bait clicks (active defense), where ad networks inject bait clicks, so any malicious users that may try to imitate these bait clicks are identified with Clicktok's algorithm and flagged as fraudulent.

### Experimentation
In order to evaluate Clicktok, the authors of the paper, used the click traffic obtained, filtered it and exposed it to a testbed with malicious apps and click malware. Through this they were able to get a click traffic that contained both legitimate and fake clicks.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2021_fall/raw/main/week_02/images/ClicktokTable1.png" title="Table 1: Passive Detection" width="320" >}}
In their experimentation, they consider *stealthy* attackers to be under 5 clicks a day per device, *sparse* to be 5-15 clicks, and *firehose* to be over 15 clicks. From Table 1, it can be seen that Clicktok with a passive defense is effective in identifying click fraud. With a longer ad network duration, leads to better inference, especially against stealth attacks.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2021_fall/raw/main/week_02/images/ClicktokTable2.png" title="Table 2: Detection Across Multiple Clickstreams" width="320" >}}
They also categorized and analyzed different click categories, where sponsored are advertisements displayed by search engines, contextual are ads displayed on a webpage based on keywords present in the webpage, and mobile are ads exclusively present on mobile devices. From the results in Table 2, it is shown that the Clicktok is able to identify fraudulent clicks across the ad categories at a high true positive rate of ~90%, and a low false positive rate at around ~0.004%.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2021_fall/raw/main/week_02/images/ClicktokTable3.png" title="Table 3: Active Defense" width="320" >}}
When applying the active defense with bait clicks, it can be seen in Table 3, that it improves detection rates. With both the increase in true positive rates, and decrease in false positive rates, show that an active defense may be important in identifying fake clicks.

Lastly, Clicktok gives an comparation between their implementation compared to other defenses, with Clicktok providing vastly lower false positive rates comparatively, and similar or better true positive rates.

### Audience Questions
What are the advantages of Generative Convolutional Autoencoder (GCAE) compared to other standard Auto Encoders (AE)?

By using the generative component, GCAE can extract more features than other regular AutoEncoders.

During the personalization step, is it done over the same parameters for all the subjects or is it done using different parameters for different subjects?

Personalization algorithms can require different parameters to improve performance for each subjects.

Does CNN require large resources for computation?

CNN is usually computationally heavy. This depends on the size of the data, along with other CNN parameters such as filter size, strides, padding, and others.
