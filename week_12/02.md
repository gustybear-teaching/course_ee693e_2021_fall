## Paper Summary

For MR images sparsity is verily used to  significantly under sample k -space. Some MR images like algorithms are sparse in the pixel representation, while on the other hand further complicated images have sparse representation in the time domain. A recent mathematical theory of compressed sensing establishes the idea of recovering sparsely represented images from randomly undersampled k -space data with the use of an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme. This paper represents the development of practical incoherent undersampling schemes and analyzes by the means of their aliasing interference. For introducing incoherence pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes are being used. The norm of a transformed image is minimized  subject to data fidelity constraints.Improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition is used for the reconstruction of brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.

- Implementations for 2D and 3D Cartesian imaging are demonstrated through experimental verification. 
- Justifies that  reduction of scan time, or alternatively, improvement of the resolution of MR imagery is possible by the sparsity of MR images.
- During image constructions, side lobes are supressed giving a better reconstruction of the signal
- CS can play an important role in many similar applications having limited scan time. 

### Weaknesses

- The paper lacks to mention a wayforward for further resaearch to apply CS for other different applications. 

### Detailed Comments

The MR images of interest are typically sparse in a transform domain rather than the usual image domain. In such a setting, incoherence is analyzed by generalizing the notion of PSF to Transform Point Spread Function (TPSF) which measures how a single transform coefficient of the underlying object ends up influencing other transform coefficients of the measured undersampled object. It is possible to exploit some of the sparsity in the slice dimension as well. The paper shows that undersampling each slice differently can reduce peak sidelobes. The paper also puts some light on the future prospects of such applications where limited scan time is a concern. The methods were verified through experimental results. 

### Methods

All experiments were performed on a 1.5T Signa Excite scanner. All CS reconstructions were implemented in Matlab using the nonlinear conjugate gradient method. 
Two linear schemes were used for comparison, zero-filling with density compensation (ZF-w/dc) and low-resolution (LR). LR consists of reconstruction from a Nyquist sampled low-resolution acquisition. For the simulation authors constructed a phantom by placing 18 features with 6 different sizes and 3 different intensities (0.33, 0.66, and 1).

There were four methods of MR imaging which were experimented upon. The first method they wanted to test was CS reconstruction performance and reconstruction artifacts with increased undersampling. This was done via simulation to examine the performance of CS reconstruction with increased undersampling compared to low resolution (LR) and zero-filling with density compensation (ZF-w/dc) and also to demonstrate the advantage of variable density random undersampling over uniform density. The simulation consisted of a constructed phantom image with 18 features in six different sizes and three different intensities which were randomly distributed to simulate an angiogram.

The second method the authors wanted to test was undersampling 2D cartesian sampling in the presence of noise. A 2D Cartesian spin-echo sequence was used to scan the phantom image in order to test the already accepted knowledge that CS reconstruction holds stable with the presence of noise and can also perform nonlinear edge preserving denoising of the image.

The third method tested was multislice 2DFT fast spin-echo brain imaging. Since brain images exhibit transform sparsity in the wavelet domain with most scans being multislice acquisitions, it is thought that CS has potential to reduce acquisition time or improve resolution within brain images. A T2 weighted multislice k-space data set was filled with a healthy brain using fast spin-echo sequence. Different sets of 80 phase-encodes were chosen randomly per slice with variable density and an acceleration factor of 2.4. Then a CS wavelet transformation was done to create sparsity along with a TV penalty. Computation time and memory load were decreased by doing 2D reconstructions of the 3D problem in the x-y and y-z planes.

The last method tested was contrast-enhanced 3D angiography. Angiograms are sparse and need to cover a very large field of view with relatively high resolution and crucial scan time which make them good candidates for CS reconstruction. The blood vessels are bright with very low background signal and are easily sparsified by both wavelet and finite differences transforms. A controlled test with simulated k-space for various degrees of undersampling was done before actually testing the method with a true k-space data set done on a first-pass abdominal contrast enhanced angiogram.

### Experimentation
The simulation results of the CS reconstruction performance and reconstruction artifacts with increased sampling in Figure 6 below found that the CS at 8 fold acceleration and variable density random undersampling had the best results. The LR reconstruction case showed a decrease in resolution with acceleration and the zero-filling showed a decrease in SNR due to incoherent interference. The higher accelerations in CS reconstruction led to increased feature losses.

The reconstruction results from the 2DFT CS reconstruction in the presence of noise (Figure 7) showed that the case of denoising with nonlinear edge-preserving TV denoising seen in part d of the figure was the best scenario for reconstruction. Compared to the SNR of 6.17 in the fully sampled phantom scan with no undersampling in part a, the ZF-w/dc reconstruction in part b had significant apparent noise, mostly due to incoherent aliasing artifacts from undersampling as well as a noise increase from the density compensation which yielded a decreased SNR of 3.79. The artifacts were suppressed by CS reconstruction in figure c which recovered the noisy image for an SNR of 9.84. However, by increasing the RMS consistency parameter to 0.1 in the nonlinear edge-preserving case, the results showed a dramatic increase in SNR to 26.9 without damaging the image quality.

The results from the multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging test  (Figure 8) had shown that the CS reconstruction exhibited significant resolution improvement over the Nyquist sampling, ZF-w/dc, and LR reconstructions. This can be seen in part a where a comparison is done with coronal and axial slices. In part b, they further tested CS reconstructions with several undersampling schemes which correspond to those in part c. It was found that reconstruction with constant data undersampling for all slices had low resolution aliasing artifacts with more pronounced artifacts in uniform undersampling. However, when each slice was undersampled differently, the artifacts significantly reduced because the theoretical TPSF peak interference is significantly smaller, enabling better recovery of the components. Therefore, variable density undersampling outperforms uniform undersampling significantly.

Lastly, the contrast enhanced 3D angiography results are shown in Figure 4 for a region of interest in the maximum intensity projection of the reconstruction results as well as a slice reconstruction from 10-fold acceleration. The left column depicts LR reconstruction exhibiting a decrease in resolution with acceleration characterized by loss of small structures and diffused blood vessel boundaries. The middle column depicts ZF-w/dc reconstruction exhibiting a decrease in SNR from incoherent interference obscuring small and dim vessels. The right column uses CS reconstruction which is exhibiting good reconstruction of vessels even at very high accelerations. The resolution and contrast are preserved with almost no loss of info up to 10-fold acceleration and not much less at 20 fold.
In Figure 10, the reconstruction results from the first pass contrast experiment in which the imaged patient has an aortobifemoral bypass graft. The arrows indicate high-grade stenosis in the native right common iliac artery. Part a shows the image with reconstruction from a complete data set. At 5 fold acceleration, we see diffused boundaries in LR (part b), a decrease in SNR for zero-fill (part c), and good vessel reconstruction for CS (part d). Flow across the stenosis is visible in CS but not for LR and ZF.

### Discussion
The authors briefly discuss computational complexity, reconstruction artifacts and other related acceleration methods. Computational complexity is noted to be iterative and more computationally intensive for CS than linear reconstruction methods. However, some methods proposed show significant reduced complexity potential. As for artifacts, ℓ1 reconstruction tends to slightly shrink the magnitude of the reconstructed sparse coefficients and smaller high frequency oscillatory artifacts appearing in some wavelet-based CS reconstructions. Although, most distinct artifacts in CS with increased acceleration are loss of low contrast features in the image. Low contrast features are typically deeply submerged by interference and are unrecoverable at the same accelerations that high contrast images can be recovered. Lastly, the authors briefly covered some other related acceleration methods such as VIPR which demonstrated high acceleration for angiography with incoherent sampling. Wajer’s thesis which suggests undersampling k-space and employing Bayesian reconstruction to randomized trajectories was also mentioned to be similar to finite difference sparsity as well as nonuniform sampling with max entropy reconstruction, which was used to successfully accelerate multidimensional NMR acquisitions, showing similarities too. In general, any other prior on the image can be incorporated in the reconstruction as long as it can be expressed as a convex constraint. Overall, CS reconstruction exploits sparsity and compressibility of MR images that can be combined with other acceleration methods that exploit different redundancies in order to reduce scan time or improve the resolution of MR imagery. This research has shown that CS can be a major help in many applications that are limited by scan time and when the images exhibit transform sparsity. 

### Questions
(1) Any ideas on how to improve MRI reconstruction besides standard CS?


(2) What are some major disadvantages that you see in this experiment?

The paper mentions that from variable density undersampling, only the weak intensity objects have reconstruction errors. So this means that lower energy higher-frequency components are ignored. This could be a problem since maybe important detail can be in the high frequency regions. They should probably account for better optimization that accounts for high and low frequency k-space data separately.

(3) Given that this article was published in 2007, do you aware of any real-world applications using this study?
