### Discussion


### Questions
(1) So to reduce overhead, the authors plan to implment the indexing algorithm in the future?

(2) Some literature mentions that, identity based crypotography causes identity recovation problem, does this paper cover this aspect?

(3) Are there any tradeoffs with optimizing the asymmetric scheme?
